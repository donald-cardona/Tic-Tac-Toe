# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is the first project I made for this profile. In this project I used JavaFx, which is similar to Java but added functions and commands
that display nodes such as buttons and labels. Below is a screenshot of a start of a new game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

### New Tic-Tac-Toe Game

The next screenshot depicts the game again but with X as the declared winner. The same outcome happens when O wins except the message will
instead say "O wins".
